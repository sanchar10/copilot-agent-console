Review code quality (see checklist below)\n3. Start the Flask server in the background\n4. Test each API endpoint with curl\n5. Write a test summary\n\n## Code Review Checklist\n- [ ] SQL injection vulnerabilities (parameterized queries?)\n- [ ] Error handling (what happens with bad input?)\n- [ ] Edge cases (empty strings, missing fields, duplicates)\n- [ ] API response consistency (all JSON, proper status codes)\n- [ ] Frontend error handling (network failures, empty states)\n- [ ] File structure matches the design\n\n## Testing Approach\n1. **API Tests**: Use curl to test each endpoint\n   - Happy path (valid input)\n   - Error cases (missing fields, invalid IDs)\n   - Edge cases (empty strings, very long input)\n2. **Integration Check**: Verify frontend correctly calls backend\n   - Check that fetch URLs match Flask routes\n   - Verify request/response format alignment\n\n## Bug Report Format\nFor each issue found:\n`\nBUG: [Short title]\nSeverity: Critical / Major / Minor\nFile: [filename:line]\nDescription: [What's wrong]\nSteps: [How to reproduce]\nFix suggestion: [Recommended fix]\n`\n\n## After Testing\n- Summarize: X tests passed, Y bugs found\n- List all bugs in priority order\n- If no bugs found, confirm the app is ready",

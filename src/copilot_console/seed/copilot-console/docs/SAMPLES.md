1. Go to **Agents** → **Morning Tech Brief** → **Automations**
2. You'll see **Daily Tech Brief** (runs at 8 AM weekdays, disabled by default)
3. Toggle it **ON** to start receiving daily briefs, or click **Run Now** to try immediately
4. Open the generated `tech-brief-YYYY-MM-DD.html` from the working directory

**Agents:** 📰 Morning Tech Brief
**Schedule:** `0 8 * * 1-5` (8 AM, Mon–Fri)

### 2. 🔍 Codebase Health Check (Workflow)

**What:** A 3-agent pipeline that scans a codebase, scores its health across 5 categories, and generates a styled HTML dashboard.

**Try it:**
1. Go to **Workflows** → **Codebase Health Check**
2. Click **▶ Run**
3. Use the 📁 button to select a project folder
4. Watch the three agents work in sequence
5. Open `health-report.html` from the working directory

**Agents:**
| Step | Agent | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| 1 | 🔍 Codebase Scanner | Inventories files, TODOs, tests, dependencies |
| 2 | 📊 Health Analyst | Scores health 0–100 across structure, tests, docs, hygiene, dependencies |
| 3 | 🎨 Report Generator | Creates a styled HTML dashboard |

### 3. ✍️ Emoji Poem (Workflow)

**What:** A 2-agent pipeline — one writes a poem on any topic, the other transforms it into a beautiful HTML page with inline emoji.

**Try it:**
1. Go to **Workflows** → **Emoji Poem**
2. Click **▶ Run**
3. Enter a topic (e.g., "shining stars", "rainy morning", "coffee")
4. The poet writes, the illustrator decorates with emoji and saves `emoji-poem.html`

**Agents:**
| Step | Agent | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| 1 | ✍️ Creative Poet | Writes a 3–5 stanza poem on the given topic |
| 2 | 🎨 Emoji Illustrator | Adds inline emoji and saves a styled HTML page |

### 4. 👨‍💼 Build a Micro-App (Agent Team)

**What:** The **Dev Lead** agent coordinates a team of 5 specialist sub-agents (architect, backend-dev, frontend-dev, qa-engineer, doc-writer) to design, build, test, and document a full-stack web app from a single prompt.

**Try it:**
1. Go to **Agents** → **Dev Lead** → **New Session**
2. Pick a starter prompt or describe your app: *"Build a task tracker where I can add tasks with priority, mark them done, and filter by status"*
3. Watch the team work — the Dev Lead delegates to each specialist in order:
   - **Architect** creates the technical design
   - **Backend Dev** implements the Python/Flask API
   - **Frontend Dev** builds the HTML/CSS/JS UI
   - **QA Engineer** reviews and tests everything
   - **Doc Writer** creates the README
4. At the end you get a working app with instructions to run it

**Starter prompts:** 📋 Task Tracker · 💰 Expense Tracker · 📓 Daily Journal

### 5. 🔧 Tool Builder (Agent)

**What:** Describe a custom tool in plain English — the agent generates a working Python tool file, drops it into `~/.copilot-console/tools/`, and it's immediately available to all agents.

**Try it:**
1. Go to **Agents** → **Tool Builder** → **New Session**
2. Describe the tool: *"Create a tool that converts CSV files to JSON"*
3. The agent writes the tool file and saves it — no restart needed
